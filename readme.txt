A plugin to allow administrators to limit the number of posts a user can publish in a given time period.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to limit the number of posts (any post type, including custom post types) that a user can publish within a specified time period.

You can set up as many limits as you like, for different post types, different user roles, whatever you like. When a user tries to create a new post, the limits are checked, if the user has exceeded any of the limits, they wont be able to publish.

= Main Features =

*	Limit the creation of any post type.
*	Limit the number of posts by user role.
*	Specify 0 to block a post type completely.
*	Time period can be in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years
*	Make a limit last forever by specifying 9999 years

In the next version I'll be adding the ability to specify post status, so you can limit the number of revisions or auto drafts (or whatever you like). I'll also be adding the ability to specify individual users as well as user roles.
In a future release I'll also be adding the ability to incorporate this functionality in custom forms.
